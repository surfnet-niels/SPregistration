Layout of the application
=========================================================================================================

All processing is routed trough index.php. A header and footer are included automatically.
The header, header.php, takes care of most of the authN and form post handling.
A functions.php page is included in the header and contains a number of generic functions used troughout the form.

For every form page a "show" and a "process" page exist. Former takes care of the form page display, the latter processes the form content and asks for confirmation. 
After confirmation, the contents of the formpage are stored in a session object.

to local preferences and is not provided
